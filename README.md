I have implemented both user and admin panels. Using that website one student would borrow a book from the library as well as a librarian could issue that book to the student. 
Featurs: 
Librarian/admin panel:
1. Librarian can login
2. Librarian can add new book details
3. Librarian can edit book details
4. Librarian can delete book details
5. Librarian can verify student
6. Librarian can issue books to students
7. Librarian can see all books and search 
8. Librarian can see all books in stock
9. Librarian can see that how many students have books rght now
10. logout

Student/User panel:
1. User can registration, after registration student account will be activated when that is verified by librarian
2. student can login 
3. student can update their profile 
4. student can search the book
5. student can see their taken books with details
6. logout
